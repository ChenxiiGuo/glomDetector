# Introduction of this project

## Why do this project?

The glomeruli, a group of small vessels, work as a filter in the kidneys which is one of the most important organs purifying the blood. Currently, the Bristol Reanl Team is doing a research and in this research, this team needs to generate plots of how glomerular volume changes against time. As a result, they need to find the glomeruli and measure the volume of them frame by frame. To save time, this team seeks help from [Dr.Neill](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/neill-w-campbell/index.html) in University of Bristol and I am doing this project under the supervision of Dr.Neill.

This image shows the glomeruli.

## Current progress(10/July/2018)

Gabor filters and K-means have been used and the result is exciting.

## Current progress(06/Aug/2018)

A neural network has been built on my own and the result it almost perfect.

Several videos generated by this neural networks have been released. You could download [here](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/glomDetector/tree/master/cnn/segVideos). The green line is the outline generated by my neural networks.

Also, videos shows the difference between machine learning methods and human engineering methods are [available](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/glomDetector/tree/master/cnn/compareVideos).

Later, I will put them in youtube.com.

## Finished

This model has been finished and I submitted the last code in 17/10/2018. With the help of finalStructure.mlx, you can train a new model. If you need the sourse images, please feel free to contact me (guochenxi.1991@gmail.com). Besides, since recently I am busy in searching jobs, this file has been messed up. Iam sorry for it. This problem will be solved soon.
